In my code there are 5 types of sampling methods. 
They are
Random sampling 
Systematic sampling
Stratified sampling
Cluster saampling
PPS sampling.
The user can use help optiion, where there is a small description about sampling methods.It also contains steps for sampling using this code.
The user can process sampling either by  manually or automatically.
The user can upload a file and save the sampled data in file directly into user's system
It built using **"Tkinder","pandas","matplotlip".**
This code uses GUI to simplify the sampling process.
Make sure the user have installed  these libraries before running the code.
